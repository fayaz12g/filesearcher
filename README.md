# What is File Searcher?
File Searcher is a tool created by Fayaz one night, over the span of two hours, after he conveyed his dismay over Windows' default File Explorer search option. In specific, Fayaz wanted to search for .sblarc files in a folder to see if there are other RootPanes in BOTW for Switch he could scale. Fayaz joked that he would write his own script that would do a better job to search, and then he proceded to do so. Chris mocked him, saying that there are many tools available that already do that, but Fayaz instead spent the next two hours making a tool that he thought would be light weight, and perfect for his needs. 

The tool is in one Python file of about 150 lines. It is fully open source and you can see all the source code in the repo. The packaged EXE is for your conveniance, with all the dependencies baked in.

# What Can it Do?
File Searcher has two main options that can be used in unison or exlusivly; seraching by file extension and searching by a string in the name. Both of these can toggle case sensitivtiy. The program also has a console that outputs the resulting files, and the paths can be Full, Truncated from the starting points, or Bare of just the file name. There are tooltips detailing this, and a progress bar showing if it is running.

# What Will Be Added?
In the future, Fayaz plans on adding a simple feature to click the results to open them in Explorer.
